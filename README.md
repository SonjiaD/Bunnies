## 🎯 Background: Why We Created This Platform

Many UBC students face challenges balancing social, academic, and personal responsibilities, leading to stress and isolation. We designed **Bunnies** to bridge these gaps by providing a unique, hybrid approach to mental health—combining social support with practical tools to improve student well-being.

Through features like matchmaking and journaling, our platform empowers students to find connections and improve mental wellness while accessing the support they need.

## 📊 Data-Driven Inspiration

Our journey began with personal experiences and informal interviews with fellow UBC students. Research revealed that a strong support network could significantly impact mental health, so we designed **Bunnies** to meet this essential need through a supportive, student-focused platform.

## 🎯 Target Audience

Our primary users are UBC students who may be struggling with mental health, stress, or loneliness. We tailored **Bunnies** to resonate with a wide range of students, from new international students to graduate students balancing academic and personal responsibilities.

## 🎨 Design and Development Process

We started with empathy maps and user stories on FigJam, simulating perspectives of diverse student groups. We researched existing mental health apps to understand best practices in design and functionality, choosing a calming color palette of pastels and soft pinks/purples to create a welcoming, accessible user experience. Our font choice, Poppins, ensures readability while maintaining a modern aesthetic.

- **User Profiles with Tags**: Users can tag interests and mental health needs, enabling meaningful connections.
- **Matchmaking Page**: Modeled after social apps, students can swipe through profiles and find friends with similar experiences.
- **Journaling Tool**: A private journaling feature for students to reflect and track their mental wellness journey.
